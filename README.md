# Tic Tac Toe in Python

This repo is solution code for one of the projects done in KopiHack, a weekly meetup that I lead at Duke University for beginners wanting to learn to code. If you want to make your own, I suggest you start [here](https://github.com/snggeng/py-tictactoe-starter)!

KopiHack's python gitbook can be found [here](https://snggeng.gitbooks.io/intro-to-python/content/).

If you study at duke and are interested, get in touch with me at geng.sng@duke.edu or via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sng.geng).
